    <h1>TwitPoll</h1>

    <p>TwitPoll keeps track of the number of Twitter followers against each
    of the UK political parties with elected representation. For each party, the
    main Twitter account is used and measures are taken hourly.
    </p>

    <p>This is an informal measure but gives a perspective on the relative public
    interest in online communication from each party.
